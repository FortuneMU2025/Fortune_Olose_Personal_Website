I'm in a room with my <strong>guitar</strong>, I'm tryna prove that I'm a <strong>star</strong>
But I hate when we keep <strong>distance</strong> 'cause it's a <strong>difference</strong> with response
Keep it <strong>natural</strong> the first day, we gon' watch Tubi in the car
Ask me what's my <strong>motivation</strong>, I say, "The <strong>trenches</strong>", she say, "<strong>Why?</strong>"

I was takin' <strong>non-prescriptions</strong>, them drugs
I wanna ask for yo' <strong>permission</strong>, don't <strong>judge</strong>
<strong>Before you ever get a job, get a gun</strong>
Gotta hit a thousand girls before you <strong>fall in love</strong>

Gotta say you <strong>older</strong> just to get inside the club
Inside the house <strong>starvin'</strong>, went to school to get <strong>lunch</strong>
<strong>Had to dress for funerals before I ever dressed for prom</strong>
Had to dress for funerals before I ever dressed for prom
        
<strong>Accept me, please, accept me for me</strong>
Don't judge me off my <strong>past life</strong>, nah, I want you to <strong>believe</strong>
All type of girls be on my line, but I ain't chasin' them though
We always around our friends, let's take <strong>vacations alone</strong>

Your last boyfriend wasn't <strong>fun</strong>, he had you stayin' at <strong>home</strong>
And I know that you was <strong>mad</strong> 'cause you was stayin' <strong>alone</strong>
For example, his friends came over, he made you <strong>stay in the room</strong>
For example, just think you with me whenever you stare at the <strong>moon</strong>

See your life is a <strong>scary movie</strong>, I can hold you in my <strong>arms</strong>
Can't cover your face with the makeup, I <strong>know who you are</strong>
Don't get your titties and ass done, <strong>I like who you are</strong>
It make you so <strong>insecure</strong> 'bout whoever you are

I was takin' non-prescriptions, them drugs
I wanna ask for yo' permission, don't judge
Before you ever get a job, get a gun
Gotta hit a thousand girls before you fall in love

Accept me, please, accept me for me
Don't judge me off my past life, nah, I want you to believe

I'm just tryna tell you <strong>who we are</strong> (are)
I'm just tryna tell you who we are (are)
I'm just tryna tell you who we are (are)
I'm just tryna tell you <strong>who we are</strong>

Hmm, who we are, tellin' all your girlfriends that I'm your <strong>star</strong>
Caught you in a <strong>dream</strong>, I hit you with that <strong>sauce</strong>
If we aim at the <strong>moon</strong>, no, baby, we won't <strong>fall</strong>
She said she miss that <strong>feelin'</strong>, a real nigga that is so <strong>appealin'</strong>

Keep it <strong>low</strong>, baby, I'm not <strong>leavin'</strong>, soakin' up your glory days <strong>slow</strong>
If there's <strong>problems</strong>, I'll <strong>solve</strong> 'em, no lie
You never had a nigga catchin' all the <strong>signs</strong>
It's <strong>time</strong>, baby, lost in the <strong>lights</strong>, everywhere I'm at with you I'm <strong>fine</strong> (you)

It's <strong>easy</strong>, baby (baby), give me the honey, honey (huh-huh)
She fuckin' with the <strong>alien</strong>, she know it, know it (yeah)
Now watch me <strong>handle</strong> it, she threw it back, I'm <strong>diggin'</strong> in that
I give you what you <strong>want</strong>, most of the girl love that

Oh-oh-oh-oh, said she never wanna come <strong>down</strong> (yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
She want that <strong>magic</strong> (yeah-yeah), kinda like a <strong>drug</strong> (c'mon)
She want that <strong>magic</strong> (yeah-yeah), better get the <strong>love, love</strong>
